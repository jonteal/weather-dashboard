# Weather Dashboard

## Description
The purpose of this application was to provide users with a dashboard to be able to look up the weather in
any city of their choice and see the weather for the day as well as a 5-day forecast. It required a deep exploration in the principles of server-side API's in order to pull data in order to populate the requests made through the code of the weather dashboard. 


## Installation
There is no installation of this application necessary. The user simply needs to navigate to the deployed link and they will be free to use this as many times as they want.


## Usage
To use the program, the user will need to enter in the search bar on the left hand side (or top center if on mobile), and search for the city of their choice. Once they hit the 'Search' button, the program will return the weather for that day, including the temperature, a description and icon depicting the conditions, the wind speed, humidity, and the UV Index. They will also get a 5-day forecast below with the date, an icon, the temperature, wind speed, and humidity for each day. Once the user enters a new search, the previous searches will populate in the left hand column in the recent searches section.
